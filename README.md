## General Info

Look Left is part of an interdisciplinary project of FU Berlin and Wei√üensee School of Art and Design Berlin with the topic Smart City. Look Left is designed to help minimize the number of traffic accidents involving pedestrians crossing the street. The warning device is to be hung at dangerous crossing points. A modified OpenDataCam is being used to track cars and when a vehicle is approaching the warning device shows a visual signal, prompting the pedestrians to pay attention and look around before crossing. ([OpenDataCam]( https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam) is an open source tool by [Move-Lab](https://www.move-lab.com/).)
The camera consists of a Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier board running the modified OpenDataCam and a USB camera connected to the board.
The warning device itself consists of an LED panel, controlled by an Arduino.
The devices communicate via LoRa. Since they are not too far away from each other there is no need for an Internet connection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
+ Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier, Nvidia Jetson X2 or Nvidia Jetson Nano
+ A USB Webcam e.g. Logitech C920 HD Pro
+ 2x Arduino Uno boards
+ 2x LoRa modules and antennas (OSOYOO SX1276 LoRa Radio Wireless 868Mhz UART Serial Module)
+ A [HT1632C](https://learn.adafruit.com/16x24-led-matrix/introduction) LED panel by Adafruit
+ Cables

### Flashing the Jetson
[Guide to how to flash your Jetson](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/jetson/FLASH_JETSON.md)

### Installation
- **The camera:**
  1. [Install the OpenDataCam on your Jetson board](https://github.com/bas1to/lookleft/blob/master/Documentation/Installation_Guide_OpenDataCam.md).
  2. Connect the USB camera to the Jetson board.
  3. Connect the LoRa module and antenna to the Arduino board.

  5. Connect the Arduino board with the Jetson board. (Allways unplug all devices from power before connecting cables.)
  6. Run the [transmitter script](https://github.com/bas1to/lookleft/blob/master/transmitter.ino) on the Arduino. (You need the Arduino IDE for that.)
  7. (Start the Jetson)
  
- **The warning device:**
  1. Connect the LED panel and the second Arduino.

  2. Connect the second LoRa module and antenna to the Arduino.

  3. Run the [receiver script]( https://github.com/bas1to/lookleft/blob/master/receiver_panel_improved.ino) on the Arduino. (You need the Arduino IDE for that.)


### Usage
- Set up the devices on your selected locations and turn on the Jetson board. The camera will start automatically.
- Switch to the `Count Itmes` tab an set a counting line as needed. Everytime a vehicle crosses this line the warning will be send and the LED panel will warn the pedestrians.
- Note: Our setup is limited for detecting vehicles only at the moment. (You can change that in the `config.json`.)
- You need a monitor for setting up the camera and the counting line. After that the setup works fine without monitor and any peripherals.
