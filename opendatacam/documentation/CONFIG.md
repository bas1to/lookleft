## ⚙️ Customize OpenDataCam

We offer several customization options:

- **Video input:** run from a file, change webcam resolution, change camera type (raspberry cam, usb cam...)

- **Neural network:** change YOLO weights files depending on your hardware capacity, desired FPS (tinyYOLO, full yolov3, yolov3-openimages ...)

- **Change display classes:** We default to mobility classes (car, bus, person...), but you can change this.

### General

#### For a standard install of OpenDataCam

All settings are in the [`config.json`](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/config.json) file that you will find in the same directory you run the install script.

When you modify a setting, you will need to restart the docker container, you can do so by:

```
# List containers
sudo docker container list

# Restart container (find id from previous command)
sudo docker restart <containerID>

# Or if you have stopped it
sudo ./run-opendatacam.sh
```

#### For a non-docker install of OpenDataCam

You need to modify the config.json file located the `opendatacam` folder.

```
<PATH_TO_OPENDATACAM>/config.json
```

Once modified,  you just need to restart the node.js app (`npm run start`), no need to re-build it, it loads the config file at runtime.

### Run opendatacam on a video file

_NB: if you are running with nvidiadocker and want to use an usbcam, please see [Run from an usbcam (step 4)](#run-from-an-usbcam)_

By default, opendatacam will try to pickup the usb webcam connected to your jetson. The settings is `VIDEO_INPUT` in the `config.json` file.

```json
"VIDEO_INPUT": "usbcam"
```

You can change this to run it on a pre-recorded file.

If you installed opendatacam through the default setup process you should have a `opendatacam_videos` folder where you ran the install script. Inside this folder you should also find a demo video: `demo.mp4`

You will need to copy the videos you want inside this folder. _(this folder gets mounted when running the container and docker has access to it)_

Once you do have the video file inside the `opendatacam_videos` folder, you can modify the `config.json` the following way:

1. Change `VIDEO_INPUT` to `"file"`

```json
"VIDEO_INPUT": "file"
```

2. Change `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS > file` with the path to your file

```json
"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS": {
  "file": "opendatacam_videos/demo.mp4"
}
```

Once `config.json` is saved, you only need to restart the docker container or restart your jetson and next time you access opendatacam, it will run on this file.

[Learn more about the others video inputs available (IP camera, Rasberry Pi in the Advanced use section)](#video_input)

**For a non-docker install of OpenDataCam:**

Follow the same instruction but note the path you will put in `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS > file` if relative to your `darknet` directory. 

For example if you have a `myvideo.mp4` file in your `darknet` directory, the settings should be:

```json
"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS": {
  "file": "myvideo.mp4"
}
```

#### Specificities of running on a file

- Opendatacam will restart the video file when it reaches the end
- When you click on record, Opendatacam will reload the file to start the recording at the beggining
- **LIMITATION: it will only record from frame nº50**


### Change neural network weights

You can change YOLO weights files depending on what objects you want to track and which hardware your are running opendatacam on.

Lighters weights file results in speed improvements, but loss in accuracy, for example `yolov3` run at ~1-2 FPS on Jetson Nano, ~5-6 FPS on Jetson TX2, and ~22 FPS on Jetson Xavier, and `yolov2-voc` runs at ~4-5 FPS on Jetson Nano, ~11-12 FPS on Jetson TX2, and realtime on Jetson Xavier.

In order to have good enough tracking accuracy for cars and mobility objects, from our experiments we found out that the sweet spot was to be able to run YOLO at least at 8-9 FPS.

For a standard install of opendatacam, these are the default weights we pick depending on your hardware:

- Jetson Nano: `yolov3-tiny`
- Jetson TX2: `yolov2-voc` _([yolov3-voc isn't available openly](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/issues/2557#issuecomment-473022989), if you trained it and want to share it, please ping us)_
- Jetson Xavier: `yolov3`

We allow you to change those settings, here is how to do it:

**For a docker (standard install) of OpenDataCam:**

We ship inside the docker container those three YOLO weights: [yolov3-tiny](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights), [yolov2-voc](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo-voc.weights), [yolov3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

In order to switch to another one, you need to change the setting `NEURAL_NETWORK` in `config.json`.

```json
{
  "NEURAL_NETWORK": "yolov2-voc"
}
```

The settings available are: `"yolov3"` , `"yolov3-tiny"`, `"yolov2-voc"`, if you want to run from others weights like [yolov3-openimages](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-openimages.weights), [yolov3-spp](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-spp.weights).. or custom trained ones, please refer to the [advanced use section below](#neural_network_params).

**For a non-docker install of opendatacam:**

The settings are the same as with the docker install, but you can also run from other weights file, [see advanced use section below](#neural_network_params)


### Track only specific classes

By default, the opendatacam will track all the classes that the neural network is trained to track. In our case, YOLO is trained with the VOC dataset, here is the [complete list of classes](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/voc.names)

You can restrict the opendatacam to some specific classes with the VALID_CLASSES option in the [config.json file](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/config.json) .

_Find which classes YOLO is tracking depending on the weights you are running. For example [yolov3 trained on COCO dataset classes](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)_

Here is a way to only track buses and person:

```json
{
  "VALID_CLASSES": ["bus","car"]
}
```

In order to track all the classes (default value), you need to set it to:

```json
{
  "VALID_CLASSES": ["*"]
}
```

*Extra note: the tracking algorithm might work better by allowing all the classes, in our test we saw that for some classes like Bike/Motorbike, YOLO had a hard time distinguishing them well, and was switching between classes across frames for the same object. By keeping all the detections classes we saw that we can avoid losing some objects, this is [discussed here](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/issues/51#issuecomment-418019606)*

### Display custom classes

By default we are displaying the mobility classes: 

![Display classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/56987855-f0101c00-6b64-11e9-8bf4-afd83a53f991.png)

If you want to customize it you should modify the `DISPLAY_CLASSES` config.  

```json
"DISPLAY_CLASSES": [
  { "class": "bicycle", "icon": "1F6B2.svg"},
  { "class": "person", "icon": "1F6B6.svg"},
  { "class": "truck", "icon": "1F69B.svg"},
  { "class": "motorbike", "icon": "1F6F5.svg"},
  { "class": "car", "icon": "1F697.svg"},
  { "class": "bus", "icon": "1F683.svg"}
]
```

You can associate any icon that are in the `/static/icons/openmojis` folder. (they are from https://openmoji.org/, you can search the unicode icon name directly there)

For example:

```json
"DISPLAY_CLASSES": [
    { "class": "dog", "icon": "1F415.svg"},
    { "class": "cat", "icon": "1F431.svg"}
  ]
```

![Display classes custom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/56992341-3028cc00-6b70-11e9-8fd8-d7e405fe4d54.png)


*LIMITATION: You can display a maximum of 6 classes, if you add more, it will just display the first 6 classes*

### Customize pathfinder colors

You can change the `PATHFINDER_COLORS` variable in the `config.json`. The app picks randomly for each new tracked object a color inside it. The colors need to be in HEX format.

```json
"PATHFINDER_COLORS": [
  "#1f77b4",
  "#ff7f0e",
  "#2ca02c",
  "#d62728",
  "#9467bd",
  "#8c564b",
  "#e377c2",
  "#7f7f7f",
  "#bcbd22",
  "#17becf"
]
```

For example, with only 2 colors:


```json
"PATHFINDER_COLORS": [
  "#1f77b4",
  "#e377c2"
]
```

![Demo 2 colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/58332468-ab993880-7e11-11e9-831a-5f958442e015.jpg)


### Customize Counter colors

You can change the `COUNTER_COLORS` variable in the `config.json`. As you draw counter lines, the app will pick the colors in the order you specified them.

You need to add "key":"value" for counter lines, the key should be the label of the color (without space, numbers or special characters), and the value the color in HEX.

For example, you can modify the default from:

```json
"COUNTER_COLORS": {
  "yellow": "#FFE700",
  "turquoise": "#A3FFF4",
  "green": "#a0f17f",
  "purple": "#d070f0",
  "red": "#AB4435"
}
```

To 

```json
"COUNTER_COLORS": {
  "white": "#fff"
}
```

And after restarting OpenDataCam you should get a white line when defining a counter area:

![Screenshot 2019-05-24 at 21 03 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/58361790-71f31c80-7e67-11e9-8b35-ecabb4a1e78a.png)

_NOTE: If you draw more line than COUNTER_COLORS defined, the lines will be black_

### Advanced settings

#### Video input

OpenDataCam is capable to take in input several video streams: pre-recorded file, usbcam, raspberry cam, remote IP cam etc etc..

This is configurable via the `VIDEO_INPUT` ans `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS` settings.

```json
"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS": {
  "file": "opendatacam_videos/demo.mp4",
  "usbcam": "v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=640, height=360 ! videoconvert ! appsink",
  "experimental_raspberrycam_docker": "v4l2src device=/dev/video2 ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=640, height=360 ! videoconvert ! appsink",
  "raspberrycam_no_docker": "nvarguscamerasrc ! video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1280, height=720, framerate=30/1, format=NV12 ! nvvidconv ! video/x-raw, format=BGRx, width=640, height=360 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw, format=BGR ! appsink",
  "remote_cam": "YOUR IP CAM STREAM (can be .m3u8, MJPEG ...), anything supported by opencv"
}
```

With the default installation, OpenDataCam will have `VIDEO_INPUT` set to `usbcam`. See below how to change this

_Technical note:_

Behind the hoods, this config input becomes [the input of the darknet](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/server/processes/YOLO.js#L32) process which then get [fed into OpenCV VideoCapture()](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/image_opencv.cpp#L577).

As we compile OpenCV with Gstreamer support when installing OpenDataCam, we can use any [Gstreamer pipeline](http://www.einarsundgren.se/gstreamer-basic-real-time-streaming-tutorial/) as input + other VideoCapture supported format like video files / IP cam streams. 

You can add your own gstreamer pipeline for your needs by adding an entry to `"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS"`

##### Run from an usbcam

1. Verify if you have an usbcam detected

```bash
ls /dev/video*
# Output should be: /dev/video0
#
```

2. Change `VIDEO_INPUT` to `"usbcam"`

```json
"VIDEO_INPUT": "usbcam"
```

3. (Optional) If your device is on `video1` or `video2` instead of default `video0`, change `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS > usbcam` to your video device, for example if /dev/video1

```json
"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS": {
  "usbcam": "v4l2src device=/dev/video1 ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=640, height=360 ! videoconvert ! appsink"
}
```

4. *(If running with nvidiadocker container)* You need allow docker to access your device when starting the container, to do this modify the `run-nvidiadocker.sh` script that should have been downloaded by the install script and set:

```
docker run --runtime=nvidia --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 -p 8080:8080 -p 8090:8090 -p 8070:8070 $DOCKER_VOLUMES -v /data/db:/data/db $@
```

##### Run from a file

See [Run opendatacam on a video file](#run-opendatacam-on-a-video-file)

##### Run from IP cam

1. Change `VIDEO_INPUT` to `"file"`

```json
"VIDEO_INPUT": "remote_cam"
```

2. Change `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS > remote_cam` to your IP cam stream, for example

```json
"VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS": {
  "remote_cam": "http://162.143.172.100:8081/-wvhttp-01-/GetOneShot?image_size=640x480&frame_count=1000000000"
}
```

NB: this IP cam won't work, it is just an example. Only use IP Cam you own yourself, see CODE OF CONDUCT (TODO @b-g)

##### Run from Raspberry Pi cam (Jetson nano)

See [dedicated documention for Jetson nano](jetson/JETSON_NANO.md#advanced-usage)

##### Change webcam resolution

As explained on the Technical note above, you can modify the Gstreamer pipeline as you like, by default we use a 640x360 feed from the webcam.

If you want to change this, you need to:

- First know which resolution your webcam supports, run `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext`.

- Let's say we will use `1280x720`

- Change the Gstreamer pipeline accordingly: `"v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=1280, height=720 ! videoconvert ! appsink"`

- Restart OpenDataCam

_NOTE: Increasing webcam resolution won't increase OpenDataCam accuracy, the input of the neural network is 400x400 max, and it might cause the UI to have logs as the MJPEG stream becomes very slow for higher resolution_

#### Use Custom Neural Network weights

In order to use other weights like [yolov3-openimages](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-openimages.weights), [yolov3-spp](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-spp.weights), custom trained ones or  ["third party" weights](https://giou.stanford.edu/)
you need to [install OpenDataCam without Docker](USE_WITHOUT_DOCKER.md) _(we will enable this for docker install at some point [#97](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/issues/97))_.

For example, if you want to use [yolov3-openimages](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-openimages.weights), you need to:

- copy `yolov3-openimages.weights` the weights file in `/darknet/yolov3-openimages.weights`
- add an entry to the `NEURAL_NETWORK_PARAMS` setting in `config.json`.

```json
"yolov3-openimages": {
  "data": "cfg/coco.data",
  "cfg": "cfg/yolov3.cfg",
  "weights": "yolov3-openimages.weights"
}
```

- change the `NEURAL_NETWORK` param to the key you defined in `NEURAL_NETWORK_PARAMS` 

```json
"NEURAL_NETWORK": "yolov3-openimages"
```

- Restart the node.js app (not need to recompile)


#### MongoDB URL

If you want to persist the data on a remote mongodb instance, you can change the setting `MONGODB_URL` .

By default the Mongodb will be persisted in the `/data/db` directory of your host machine

#### Tracker accuracy display

The tracker accuracy layer shows a heatmap like this one:

![Screenshot 2019-06-12 at 18 59 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/60195072-c6106880-983a-11e9-8edd-178a38d3e2a2.JPG)

This heatmap highlights the areas where the tracker accuracy **isn't really good** to help you:

- Set counter lines where things are well tracked
- Decide if you should change the camera viewpoint

_Behind the hoods, it displays a metric of the tracker called "zombies" which represent the predicted bounding box when the tracked isn't able to asign a bounding box from the YOLO detections._

You can tweak all the settings of this display with the `TRACKER_ACCURACY_DISPLAY` setting.

| nbFrameBuffer          | Number of previous frames displayed on the heatmap                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| radius                 | Radius of the points displayed on the heatmap (in % of the width of the canvas)                                                                                                                                          |
| blur                   | Blur of the points displayed on the heatmap (in % of the width of the canvas)                                                                                                                                            |
| step                   | For each point displayed, how much the point should contribute to the increase of the heapmap value (the range is between 0-1), increasing this will cause the heatmap to reach the higher values of the gradient faster |
| gradient               | Colors gradient, insert as many values as you like between 0-1 (hex value supported, ex: "#fff" or "white")                                                                                                              |
| canvasResolutionFactor | In order to improve performance, the tracker accuracy canvas resolution is downscaled by a factor of 10 by default (set a value between 0-1)                                                                             |

```json
"TRACKER_ACCURACY_DISPLAY": {
  "nbFrameBuffer": 300,
  "settings": {
    "radius": 3.1,
    "blur": 6.2,
    "step": 0.1,
    "gradient": {
      "0.4":"orange",
      "1":"red"
    },
    "canvasResolutionFactor": 0.1
  }
}
```

For example, if you change the gradient with:

```json
"gradient": {
  "0.4":"yellow",
  "0.6":"#fff",
  "0.7":"red",
  "0.8":"yellow",
  "1":"red"
}
```

![Other gradient](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/533590/59389118-ec66dc00-8d43-11e9-8310-309da6ab42e1.png)
